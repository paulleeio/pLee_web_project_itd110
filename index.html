        <h2>How we met</h2>
        <p>Both cats were originally my wife&apos;s before we got married. Once we tied the knot on <time datetime="2017-03-25">March 25, 2017</time>, the cats came along for the ride. The cats have added a lot of fun to my life so I wanted to create a web page to honor them. Some more information about the cats:</p>

                    <h3>Saber</h3> 
                    My wife adopted Saber (brown tabby) first. She named <a href="https://fateuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Saber">Saber</a> after her favorite character from the Anime <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/stay_night">Fate Stay Night</a></i>. Saber (the cat) does not really <a href="https://fateuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Saber#Personality">live up to the name of Saber from the anime</a>. Our Saber is a very lazy cat and does not have a lot of responsibilities. We still love her all the same as she&apos;s very friendly and loving. Saber loves sitting in people&apos;s laps and will ingratiate herself to anyone. Guests will often find Saber trying to sneak her way into their laps.

            <li><article><h3>Cassini</h3>
                My wife adopted Cassini (tuxedo) second. Cassini was named after one of the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/">satellites orbiting Saturn</a>. This was because my wife&apos;s favorite sailor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon"><i>Sailor Moon</i></a> is <a href="https://sailormoon.fandom.com/wiki/Hotaru_Tomoe_/_Sailor_Saturn_(anime)">Sailor Saturn</a>. Cassini was originally a feral cat but was found by a cat rescue. Cassini was very skittish at first but she eventually warmed up to us. Now she loves lazing luxuriously and getting brushed. This doesn't extend to new people though. She <b>usually</b> does not warm up to a guest until they&apos;ve been to our house a few times. <aside> Like 10 times-ish</aside>
