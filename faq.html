                <div>Are they indoor or outside cats?</div><br>
                <div>Indoor cats. We&apos;ve had them outside before, but they both prefer indoors. Cassini hates outdoors and will cling to the wall when outside. I think this is due to her growing up as a feral cat. </div><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Who is older?</div><br>
                <div>Saber is older. Although Cassini is more responsible. It&apos;s hard to tell which cat is older because of them both being rescues. Many of these organizations don&apos;t have strong bookkeeping.  </div><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Who is smarter?</div><br>
                <div>Cassini is smarter. She was able to solve puzzles much faster than Saber </div><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Who is more friendly?</div><br>
                <div>Saber is way more friendly. She will plop down on the lap of anyone. Cat sitters have sent pictures of Saber cuddling with them before. </div><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Do they play together?</div><br>
                <div>Rarely. They like being in the same room and area as each other but not playing together. It&apos;s very odd. The closest they&apos;ve been is when we moved. They were unsure of the environment and would share a cat carrier voluntarily </div><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Who do the cat's like better?</div><br>

                <div>Saber hands down likes my wife more than she likes me. Cassini usually likes me better but it can vary. Cat emotions are very fickle.</div>

            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Who do you like more?</div><br>
                <div>Like any good fur parent, I love both cats equally.</div><br>
