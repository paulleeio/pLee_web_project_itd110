        <h1>Saber&apos;s Habits</h1>
        <p>Saber spends a good deal of time on the cat tower these days to avoid our infant son (he was born on <time datetime="2023-03-10">March 10, 2023</time>), also known as <span class="mario"><a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Day">Super Mario Day!</a></span> When he&apos;s at daycare or asleep she comes out of the woodwork. We have come to realize that Saber&apos;s calling in life is to be a lap cat. She loves nothing more than sitting in a lap. I work from home so during the day she will try to find her way onto my lap. This works as long as I&apos;m not in a meeting or doing something strenuous.  </p>

            <h2>Favorite toys</h2>
        <p>Saber&apos;s favorite thing to play with is teaser toys especially ones with feathers and bells. I think she likes the sound of the wind through the feathers and the jingling of the bells. Oddly enough she really loves when I lightly tap her with the teaser toy. It never fails to get her to perk up. When she was younger she would jump for the teaser toy. These days she&apos;ll mostly swipe and stand for it. Every now and then we get a good jump. <p>

            <h2>Lazy play</h2>
        <p>Saber also loves playing with this ball toy. The ball goes in a circle. There have been times when she would be laying down next to the ball toy and lazily swiping at it to get the ball going. Saber also loves playing with the puzzle box for treats. She can get the middle tiles really easy but the side tiles can trip her up.  </p>
