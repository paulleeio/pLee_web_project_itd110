        <h1>Cassini&apos;s Habits</h1>
        <p>Cassini has a resting grumpy face but is a <em>very sweet</em> cat. She has a habit of liking enclosed spaces like boxes, and cubbies. I think this is related to her time as a feral cat. Cassini has very soft fur and does a good job of keeping herself well groomed.</p>

            <h2>She likes her caves</h2>
        <p>In the picture below, I was able to find a cat bed cubby that fits in a cube shelf slot. This ended up being a great purchase and Cassini spends a lot of time in there. Cassini has a lot of fur so there's <mark>always</mark> a bunch of fur in the cube! </p>

            <h2>Judgemental cat</h2>
        <p>Cassini&apos;s main habits are to look out the window and judge people. Her resting grumpy face helps with this. It makes it seem like she&apos;s judging everyone harshly. There was a time when my wife and I were living in an 11th floor apartment. This was the golden age of Cassini&apos;s window watching days. We would try to look for her whenever we left the house.  </p>

            <h2>Cool cat gallery</h2>
        <p>Cassini is also a great hunter. Whenever there is a bug flying around he house and Cassini spots it, she goes into <u>attack mode</u>. She will make this chittering sound and then track the bug. I&apos;ve seen her catch a lot of flies, June bugs, and the like. Cassini also will make chittering sounds when she sees a bird get close by. </p>
