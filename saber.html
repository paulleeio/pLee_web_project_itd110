        <h1>Saber our friendly cat</h1>
        <p>Saber is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat">brown tabby</a>. She is over 10 years old now. Her eyes are almost always dilated because she is going blind. This hasn&apos;t really slowed her down any, and vets have told us that cats do not rely on sight too much. </p>

            <h2>Saber's personality and look</h2>
        <p>Saber has a very fun fur pattern. I like how her tail is all black at the end so it&apos;s almost like it&apos;s tipped in ink. Saber <u>likes</u> having a collar on. Once when we took it off, we noticed that she was a little depressed and would constantly lay near the collar and try to roll on it. After we put the collar back on she was back to her usual cheerful self.</p>

            <h2>Tabby kitten video</h2>
            <p>I couldn't find a video of Saber as a kitten, but I found this video of another tabby kitten. I think it shows what they usually look like prety well.</p>

            <h2>Some things she likes</h2>
        <p>Saber loves to eat wet food and something that always get&apos;s her attention is the sound of a can of cat food being opened, or tapped. It&apos;s fun because if she&apos;s in a higher level of the house and we open the can we can hear her scurrying off her cat tower down to the kitchen.  </p>
        <p>Saber is a very easy going cat and over the years we&apos;ve been able to get her to wear a lot of costumes and hats. </p>
