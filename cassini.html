        <h1>Cassini our graceful grump</h1>
        <p>Cassini is a tuxedo cat. She is also over 10 years old. Cassini has always had good health, and pretty much every vet visit has been good. Cassini likes to run around and chase things. Cassini is also a bit more aggressive and will bully Saber. Cassini has a resting grumpy face but she&apos;s a very nice cat (except to Saber). </p>

            <p>This isn't Cassini. It's a Tuxedo kitten that kind of looks like her</p>

            <h2>Cassini's personality</h2>
        <p>Cassini&apos;s favorite toys are anything that involves chasing &#127939;. We used to buy fancy toys but over the years we realized her favorite ones are hair bands, and a long shoelace. Cassini also likes when we throw some of the smaller toys and will even bring it back to us! Another game we play is throwing the smaller treats. Cassini will get into a hunter mode and try to follow the treat by sound and smell. </p>

            <h2>Thing's Cassini likes</h2>
        <p>We got a really cool puzzle box from Chewy (link below). The way this puzzle box works is that you put treats inside of it and then the cat will try to fish the treats out. Cassini likes this puzzle box because it adds a challenge to her snacking. I think another reason she loves the puzzle box is that Saber has trouble with it, so Cassini can eat it at her leisure. </p>
        <p>Cassini <b>loves</b> getting brushed. We brush her a lot and it seems like she never runs out of fur. We recently got a brush that has an integrated water spray/steamer. This has been a great hit and Cassini loves this brush.</p>
